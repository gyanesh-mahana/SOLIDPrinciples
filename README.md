SOLID Principles:
1. S - Single Responsibility Principle
2. O - Open Close Principle
3. L - Liskov Substitute Principle
4. I - Interface Segregation Principle
5. D - Deepndency Inversion Principle


Single Responsibility Principle
  - "A class should have only one reason to change"
Open Closed Principle
  - "Software entities such as classes, modules, functions etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification."
Liskov Substitute Principle
  - "S is a subtype of T, Then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S"
Interface Segregation Principle
  - "No clients should be  forced to depend on methods it does not use"
Dependency Inversion Principle
  - "Highlevel modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions"
